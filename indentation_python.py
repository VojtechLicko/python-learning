# Where in other languages indentation is just for readability only, in python, indentation is very important


if 5 > 2:
    print()
# print("five is greater than two !")  this is the wrong syntax in order to work the code should look like this:

# Python throws error at you if you don't indent

if 5 > 2:
    print("five is greater than two")  # this is the syntax we have in python (its called block of code)

# The indentation should always be multiple of four
# You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error
